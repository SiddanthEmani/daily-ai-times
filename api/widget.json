The position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluativ",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.05370v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Co",
