The goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of the training examples. For instance, our approach discove",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.06712v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal",

      "description": "The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their\nsafety and reliability in practical applications. Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes\nmodels using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands.\nHowever, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is\nfrequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose gamma-PO, a\ndynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm",
