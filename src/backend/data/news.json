Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM1000",
