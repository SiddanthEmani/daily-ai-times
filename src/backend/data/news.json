As time progresses, concept drift occurs and previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in the accuracy of online predictions.

      "description": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal\nreasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in\nreal-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy\nrequirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling\ncollaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL\nfor MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational\ndemands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs",
