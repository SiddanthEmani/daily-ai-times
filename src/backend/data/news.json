In a simple yet\nrevealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when\nprovided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance\nthan MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may\ngenerate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them\nduring reasoning. Motivated by th",

We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability\n(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence\nwith an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,\ndeprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a\njudge model evaluates the debat",
