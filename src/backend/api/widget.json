      "description": "arXiv:2506.06282v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective financial reasoning demands not only textual understanding but also the ability to interpret complex visual data such as charts, tables, and trend graphs. This paper introduces a new benchmark designed to evaluate how well AI models - especially large language and multimodal models - reason in finance-specific contexts. Covering 3,200 expert-level question-answer pairs across 15 core financial topics, the benchmark integrates both textua",

Traditional approaches that introduce \"dummy instances\" or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a proposal is defended in which such cases are modeled using the intersections of actual types rather than specific non existent tokens.

      "description": "arXiv:2506.06285v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS) have gained significant attention due to their ability to adaptively update their structure in response to data dynamics while maintaining interpretability. However, the lack of publicly available implementations of these models limits their accessibility and widespread adoption. To address this gap, we present evolvingfuzzysystems, a Python library that provides implementations of several well-established eFS models,",
