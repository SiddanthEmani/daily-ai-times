In agent problems that\nrequire interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before\nacting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new\ninformation from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this\nwork, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of\ntest-time scaling that increases the age",
