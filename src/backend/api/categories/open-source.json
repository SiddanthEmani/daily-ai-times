      "description": "Creating accurate, physical simulations directly from real-world robot motion\nholds great value for safe, scalable, and affordable robot learning, yet\nremains exceptionally challenging. Real robot data suffers from occlusions,\nnoisy camera poses, dynamic scene elements, which hinder the creation of\ngeometrically accurate and photorealistic digital twins of unseen objects. We\nintroduce a novel real-to-sim framework tackling all these challenges at once.\nOur key insight is a hybrid scene represent",
