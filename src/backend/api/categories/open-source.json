      "description": "In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing\napproaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which\ninherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or\nscience domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex\nvisual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image\ndetails. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel\nreasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced f",
