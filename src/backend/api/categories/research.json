This paper introduces a new benchmark designed to evaluate how well AI models - especially large language and multimodal models - reason in finance-specific contexts. Covering 3,200 expert-level question-answer pairs across 15 core financial topics, the benchmark integrates both textua",

The goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of the training examples. For instance, our approach discove",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.06712v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.06719v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species. The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in the",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.06729v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inferenc",
