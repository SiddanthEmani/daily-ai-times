      "description": "arXiv:2506.11154v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between the hearing-impaired community and society. This paper introduces SLRNet, a real-time webcam-based ASL recognition system using MediaPipe Holistic and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model processes video streams to recognize both ASL alphabet letters and functional words. With a validation accuracy of 86.7%, SLRNet demonstrates the feasibili",

However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)",
