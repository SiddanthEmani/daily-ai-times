      "description": "arXiv:2506.05352v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This work lays the foundations for a rigorous ontological characterization of love, addressing its philosophical complexity and scientific relevance, with particular emphasis on psychology and sociology, as well as highlighting ways in which such characterization enhances relevant AI based applications. The position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluativ",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.05370v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Co",

This method ensures that state transitions and policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions -- eschewing pro",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.05405v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematical",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.05409v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity. We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.05412v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65), and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 o",
