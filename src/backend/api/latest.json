      "description": "arXiv:2506.08324v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called",

High-speed cameras are used to measure the impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming and prone to human error.

      "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain\nQuestion Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer\ncontext, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods\ndo not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the\nperformance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or\nECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by c",

In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents\ncan self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their\nstrategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed\nthrough the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of\nLLM-based agents, from a simple",
