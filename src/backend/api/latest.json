      "description": "In this post, we introduce Amazon Nova customization for text content moderation through Amazon SageMaker AI, enabling organizations to fine-tune models for their specific moderation needs. The evaluation across three benchmarks shows that customized Nova models achieve an average improvement of 7.3% in F1 scores compared to the baseline Nova Lite, with individual improvements ranging from 4.2% to 9.2% across different content moderation tasks.",
