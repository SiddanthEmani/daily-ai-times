      "description": "In this post, we explore how Qbtech streamlined their machine learning (ML) workflow using Amazon SageMaker AI, a fully managed service to build, train and deploy ML models, and AWS Glue, a serverless service that makes data integration simpler, faster, and more cost effective. This new solution reduced their feature engineering time from weeks to hours, while maintaining the high clinical standards required by healthcare providers.",
