You'll learn how to deploy A2A servers on AgentCore Runtime, configure agent discovery and authentication, and build a real-world multi-agent system for incident response. We'll cover the complete A2A request lifecycle, from agent card discovery to task delegation, showing how standardized protocols eliminate the complexity of multi-agent coordination.",
