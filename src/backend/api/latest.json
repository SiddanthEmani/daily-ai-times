With this powerful new capability, you can write Python scripts directly within your workflow, alleviating the need for separate AWS Lambda functions for simple logic. This feature streamlines preprocessing and postprocessing tasks (like data normalization and response formatting), simplifying generative AI application development and making it more accessible across organizations.",
