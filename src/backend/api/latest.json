      "description": "Hugging Face has unveiled FinePDFs, the largest publicly available corpus built entirely from PDFs. The dataset spans 475 million documents in 1,733 languages, totaling roughly 3 trillion tokens. At 3.65 terabytes in size, FinePDFs introduces a new dimension to open training datasets by tapping into a resource long considered too complex and expensive to process. By Robert Krzaczyński",
