      "description": "In this post, we demonstrate how Amazon Nova Premier with Amazon Bedrock can systematically migrate legacy C code to modern Java/Spring applications using an intelligent agentic workflow that breaks down complex conversions into specialized agent roles. The solution reduces migration time and costs while improving code quality through automated validation, security assessment, and iterative refinement processes that handle even large codebases exceeding token limitations.",
