      "description": "In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and Claude are enabling enterprises like Cox Automotive and Druva to deploy production-ready agentic AI systems that deliver measurable business value, with results including up to 63% autonomous issue resolution and 58% faster response times. We examine the technical foundation combining Claude's frontier AI capabilities with AgentCore's enterprise-grade infrastructure that allows organizations to focus on agent logic rather than building...",
