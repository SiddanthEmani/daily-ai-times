      "description": "Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on\nvisual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must\nsuccessfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares\nVLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability\nto integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric\nbenchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform\nsubstantially worse than their visual en",

To address this\nchallenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that\nuses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons.
