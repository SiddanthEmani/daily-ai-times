      "content": "arXiv:2507.22493v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework, termed LVM-GP, for uncertainty quantification in solving forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy data. The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from the input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling uncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture consists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The...",
