      "description": "In this post, we explore how log probabilities work with imported models in Amazon Bedrock. You will learn what log probabilities are, how to enable them in your API calls, and how to interpret the returned data. We also highlight practical applications—from detecting potential hallucinations to optimizing RAG systems and evaluating fine-tuned models—that demonstrate how these insights can improve your AI applications, helping you build more trustworthy solutions with your custom models.",
