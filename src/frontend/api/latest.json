In this post, we explain how to use EAGLE 2 and EAGLE 3 speculative decoding in Amazon SageMaker AI, covering the solution architecture, optimization workflows using your own datasets or SageMaker's built-in data, and benchmark results demonstrating significant improvements in throughput and latency.",
